        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
            The Loma Theater opened its doors to Socorro residents in 1937. Located on the town plaza, it was in the center of all that was happening in town. However, 19 years later, in December of 1956, a large fire broke out in an adjacent business and spread to the theater during a showing of <em>"The Day the World Ended."</em> While the fire completely destroyed the theater, over 200 people escaped unscathed.

        <h2>Rebirth and Relocation</h2>
        <p>
            After the fire, the Loma Theater was reborn in its current location, a historic building listed on the State Historic Register. Originally constructed as a general store in the early 1900s, the building served as a National Guard armory before being remodeled into a theater in 1959.

        <h2>Unique Features</h2>
        <p>
            The original theater featured seating for over 600 people, with special "crying" and "smoking" rooms equipped with drive-in speakers. In 1986, the theater underwent significant renovations that altered its structure and reduced its seating capacity.

        <h2>Recent History</h2>
        <p>
            The theater faced challenges, including closures in 2008 and 2014, but was revived in 2017 through a partnership with New Mexico Tech. Modern renovations, including digital and 3D capabilities, brought the theater back to life. Ownership transferred to On the Break Entertainments, LLC, in 2021.
